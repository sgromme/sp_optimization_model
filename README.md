Supply planning optimization model
Code was generate by Claude.ai

Question:
Is there a tool to model a supply planning problem?  If not how would I go about designing one?

Response:
I can help you create a tool for supply planning optimization. Let me create a Python implementation that can handle basic supply planning scenarios.
Supply Planning Optimization ModelClick to open code
I've created a supply planning optimization tool using Python and the PuLP library for linear programming. Here's how to use it:
The model includes:

Multiple products and time periods
Production, inventory, and backlog decisions
Capacity constraints
Cost optimization (production, inventory holding, and backlog costs)
Initial inventory consideration
Demand satisfaction constraints

Would you like me to:

Add more features like setup costs or minimum production quantities?
Include additional constraints like workforce limitations?
Add visualization capabilities for the results?
Create a more detailed example with specific business scenarios?
